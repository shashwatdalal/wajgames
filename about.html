MY PROGRAMMING HISTORY, BEING THE LONGEST OF ANY OF THE MEMBERS IN THIS GROUP, BEGAN IN 4TH GRADE WITH SCRATCH AND ETOYS ON AN OLPC XO. FROM THEN I WENT INTO HTML, CSS, AND JAVASCRIPT, SUCCESSFULLY BUILDING MY OWN WEBSITE IN THE SUMMER OF 2009 OR 2010, THOUGH IT WAS NEVER HOSTED AND ONLINE UNTIL 2013 (STILL ONLINE AT AMANOKAMI.NET). AFTER A COUPLE YEARS OF NOT PROGRAMMING OR COMPUTERING, I CAME BACK IN 8TH GRADE WITH RUBY, AND INTO MY FRESHMEN YEAR, SPREAD MY LANGUAGE RANGE TO C, JAVA, RUBY, EMACS LISP, AND PREVIOUSLY I ALREADY HAD HTML, CSS, AND JAVASCRIPT ABILITIES. I PLAN TO LEARN PYTHON, RAILS, AND C++ AS WELL IN THE FUTURE. FROM MY CURRENT POSITION IN THIS GROUP, IT SHOULD BE OBVIOUS THAT MY STRENGTHS IN COMPUTER ARE NOT LIMITED TO PROGRAMMING, BUT INTO NETWORKING AND HARDWARE AS WELL, AND, BEING THE ONLY ONE WITH LINUX (SPECIFICALLY DEBIAN) EXPERIENCE, WAS ANOTHER FACTOR THAT HELPED ME EARN MY POSITION. I VERY MUCH ENJOY BEING IN CONTROL OF THE SERVER AND I HOPE I CAN MAINTAIN IT WELL ENOUGH TO PREVENT BLACKOUTS!"><img class="example-image" src="images/Paul.jpg" alt="Plants: image 1 0f 4 thumb" width="15%" height="15%"/></a>

I HAVE BEEN A PART OF THE STORY DEVELOPMENT TEAM WHICH UNDERSTANDABLY ISN’T REALLY NEEDED FOR A ARCADE STYLE GAME. IT IS HOWEVER AN ADDED BONUS AND HAS ALLOWED ME TO USE MY PERSONAL LOVE OF STORIES AND PLOTS TO CREATE BACKGROUNDS TO THE GAMES FEATURED ON WAJGAMES.COM."><img class="example-image" src="images/Jason.jpg" alt="Plants: image 1 0f 4 thumb" width="15%" height="15%"/></a>

BEFORE JOINING THIS GROUP, I’VE HAD ZERO EXPERIENCE IN MAKING WEBSITES. THUS, I DON’T TAKE PART IN PROGRAMMING AND THE FOUNDATION OF THE WEBSITE, BUT ONLY THE SOUND AND MUSIC. IN FACT, I AM A MUSICAL PERSON, AND I WANTED TO TRY A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TYPE OF MUSIC, INCLUDING SOUND EFFECTS AND COMPOSING THE BACKGROUND MUSIC. I HOPE THAT THE MUSIC I MAKE WILL BRIGHTEN UP YOUR GAMING TIME-A LITTLE, IF NOT A LOT."><img class="example-image" src="images/Hinako.jpg" alt="Plants: image 1 0f 4 thumb" width="15%" height="15%"/></a>
